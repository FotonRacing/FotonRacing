Thanks to its <b>low weight</b>, its average speed is <b>70km/h</b>, which means that it can travel across 20 meters tall track in only one second. Despite this, we still try our best to <b>improve</b> his average speed, since our bolide will compete with the <b>best vehicles</b> on world finals of “F1 in Schools” in Singapore </span>
